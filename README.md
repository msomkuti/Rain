# Rain
This project was one of my first encounters with the Processing IDE, and is based on The Coding Train's Purple Rain Coding Challenge Video. At first I just followed the video, but I quickly discovered that Processing is fun to work with! I was inspired to create my own original animation, using the solution in the video as a foundation. Foreground.png is an original vector drawing created in Adobe Illustrator, as well as the code written to add thunder claps to the rain. I also plan on adding gusts of wind.

To make this animation run smoother, you raise the maximum amount of memory that Processing can use in its preferences. I am working on improving draw speed from the code side as well to get a more consistent frame rate. 

Processing is fun to work with, but I worked in Python, having to translate a bunch of the documentation from Java. Note that error codes in the console print in Java as well.
